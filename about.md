I'm a business analyst at Nubank, the world's largest independent digital bank. Sometimes I read tech trends & VC trends & try to write about that.  

I prefer hot summers over cold winters, Star Wars over Star Trek and iOS over Android.

Also, I believe that commercial trips to Mars will be viable within three decades, the Generation Z will live until 150 years and Artificial General Intelligence is the most important topic we should all be discussing right now.
